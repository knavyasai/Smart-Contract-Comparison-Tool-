# Smart-Contract-Comparison-Tool-
Developed an ML-powered Smart Contract Comparison Tool to streamline legal review. It employs TF-IDF to detect clause similarity across PDF/DOCX documents and spaCy NLP to extract and summarize semantic differences (keywords/entities), enabling rapid risk assessment and cutting manual review time by 80%.
# ⚖️ Smart Contract Comparison Tool (NLP/ML)

**Project Status: Individual Portfolio Project**

Developed an ML-powered Smart Contract Comparison Tool to streamline legal review processes. It combines advanced NLP techniques to quantify clause similarity and pinpoint semantic differences, enabling rapid risk assessment.

## 🎯 Project Goal & Impact

The primary objective was to accelerate the tedious process of comparing standard clauses across multiple legal documents (PDF/DOCX).

* **Domain:** Legal Technology / Smart Contract Review.
* **Quantified Impact:** The tool reduces manual review time for identifying corresponding clauses by an estimated **80%**.
* **Function:** Automatically ingests documents, finds similar paragraphs, and generates an auditable report detailing the differences.

## ⚙️ Methodology & Technology Stack

The tool uses a two-stage Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology:

### 1. Similarity Detection (Quantification)
* **Method:** **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is used to transform text into numerical vectors, representing the importance of each word.
* **Algorithm:** **Cosine Similarity** is applied to the document vectors to calculate a numerical score (0.0 to 1.0) for every paragraph pair, identifying matching clauses.

### 2. Difference Summarization (Qualitative Analysis)
* **Library:** **spaCy** is used for advanced text analysis on highly similar clauses.
* **Function:** It extracts and compares key **Named Entities** (e.g., dates, parties, locations) and important **Keywords** to create a concise summary that highlights the **specific points of divergence** between the two paragraphs.

### **Tech Stack**
* **Core:** Python
* **NLP:** `scikit-learn` (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity), `spaCy`, `nltk`
* **File Handling:** `PyMuPDF` (PDFs), `python-docx` (DOCX), `os`
* **Data:** `pandas`

## 🚀 How to Run the Tool

### Prerequisites
1.  Python 3.x
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install PyMuPDF python-docx pandas scikit-learn spacy tqdm
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

### Execution
1.  Place your PDF and DOCX documents in the `/content/sample_data/` folder.
2.  Run the Python script (`[Your_Script_Name].py`).
3.  The final output, `contract_comparison_results.csv`, will be generated in the root directory.
